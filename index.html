        <p class="lead mb-4"> At a young age I've always loved books. I love how books transport you to a new place and help you make you have new experiences that never require you to leave the comfort of your home. I've been writing stories since 1st grade and it has always been easy and fun for me. The emotions that people can feel and the adventures they can take amazes me. Knowing that I can make people feel the same feeling is great. One job that I have had experience with is running a babysitting service. At a very young age me and sisters were watching our cousins, family friends and more. After a while of babysitting we realized that we could make money off of babysitting so we decided to create a babysitting service. It wasn't big but when talking to people we would mention it. This made me very experienced with kids and learning how to deal with them. For example I learned how to soothe crying children, entertain children, and take care of their needs. I learned how to make bottles, change diapers and pull ups, put kids to sleep, and sometimes bathe them if need be. I also learned money management when my sisters would split the money between all of us. It was definitely a group effort and it helped me at a young age learn how to work within a business even if it wasn't a real or big business. <br><br>

        My second piece of work experience was after the pandemic me and mom started to do instacart. Instacart is a service where you order groceries or items for stores like ralphs, cvs, or even sephora and someone will go get those items and deliver them to your door in a timely manner. My mom and I worked as instacart shoppers and this helped me learn time management because you have to get groceries in a certain amount of time and this also helped me with memorization skills because i learned all the items and where they would be in specific stores. What items would be with what.<br><br>

        Lastly, my first real job was working in a BBQ restaurant called Lucilleâ€™s Smokehouse BBQ. first i was a busser. i went around cleaning up the restaurant. I would clean things like tables, the bathroom, and sweeping floors. I also used to roll silverware and get things from the back. I was there for anything they needed from me. Next I was promoted to take out specialist. Take out specialist was when I had a lot more responsibility. I had to pack up orders and make sure everything was correct, hand out orders, take orders and manage money in the front. I also had to clean up my station every night and prepare for the next day. Later I got promoted again to hostess. This position came with seating people, putting people on a waitlist and depending on the time of day I would have to be a hostess,  busser, and take out specialist at the same time.
